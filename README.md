Output: D C B A
```

8. If Marks> =40 --> pass	ELSE ---> fail use ternary operator

9. Calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 and N (inclusive) that are multiples of a given integer X.

10. Generate and print the multiplication tables(only 10) for the numbers 2, 3, and 4  using loops. Each table should be space-separated integers, and each table should start on a new line.

11. By using while loop and continue statement Print all number from 1 to n but then it should not be divisible by 5

12. Write a program to print even numbers from 1 to n except numbers which are divisible by 4. Use Continue statement to avoid printing.

13. Write a program to print all the numbers from 1 to n .If m is present in between the sequence then stop printing any other number and break out of the loop.

14. Given an integer n perform the following conditional actions. If n is odd print weird. If n is even and in this inclusive range of 2 to 5 print not weird. If n is even and in this inclusive range of 6 to 20 then print weird. If n is even and greater than 20 print or not weird.

15. There are three line of output the first contain an integer, second contain a double, third contain a string. the output must be first line print string, second line print double, third line print int.

16. Input: Every line of input will contain a string followed by an integer. Each string will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters and each integer will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 999.	Output: In each line of output there should be two columns. The first column contain the string and left justified using exactly 15 characters. The second column contain the integer, expressed in exactly 3 digits. If the original input has less than 3 digit you must add your output leading digits with zeroes.

18. In a premier championship series of sports car racing initially the 1st car is ahead of the 2nd car by x meters. After that in every second the 1st car moves ahead by n1 meter and the 2nd car moves ahead n2 meter (in the same direction). the task is to print the number of seconds after which the 2nd car crosses the 1st car. if it is impossible to do so, then print -1.

```
Input:				Input:

3	value of n1		5	Value of n1

4	value of n2		4	Value of n2

Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000 decimal = 128		Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

21. Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values. Input: n = 5 Output: true Explain: The binary representation of 5 is: 101

22. Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division, and mod operator. The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 would be truncated to -2.

```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3	Output: 3  
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3		Output: -2
```

23. You have numCoconuts coconut shells that are initially full of water. You can exchange numExchange empty coconut shells from the market with one full coconut shell of water. The operation of drinking a full of water turns it into an empty coconut shell. Given the two integers numCoconuts and numExchange return the maximum number of coconut shells of water you can drink. Input: numCoconuts = 9	numExchange = 3	output: 13

24. There are many needy people who need some money are standing in a row. the person who stands at ith position need i \* i rs money. you have X rs. and you want to fulfil the needs of people. when you donate the money to any people it is deducted from x. you have to find how many peoples can fulfil their needs by your money.

```
input: 14	output: 3
input: 35	output: 4
```

25. Compute the natural logarithm of 2 by adding up to n terms in the series 1 – ½ + 1/3 – ¼ + 1/5 - ……….. 1/n where n is a positive integer and input by user.

26. You have a collection of n cards, each of which has a number written on it. There are k cards with odd numbers, and the rest are even numbers. Your goal is to divide these cards into chunks in such a way that the sum of numbers in each chunk is odd, and each chunk contains more than one card. You need to determine the maximum number of chunks that can be created under these constraints.

```
