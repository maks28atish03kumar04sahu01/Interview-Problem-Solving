# JAVA PROBLEMS RELATED TO MATHS AND BASICS

## 1. PRINT "HELLO WORLD!" AND "WELCOME TO PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE"

1. create `main()` function

2. create a Function called `func()`

3. Print or return the value `Welcome To Java Programming Language.`

4. inside `main()` function add `System.out.println("Hello World");`

5. Call the `func()` function inside the `main()` function

## 2. TAKE NOTHING, RETURN NOTHING TYPE FUNCTION IN PROGRAMMING

1. create `main()` function

2. create a function called `TNRN()`

3. print a statement so that when the  user calls the function, it will display

4. in `main()` function call the `TNRN()` function

5. Take Nothing Return Nothing is a type of function where during function call user will not send any argument to the function and function will not return any type of value during function call.

## 3. TAKE NOTHING RETURN SOMETHING TYPE FUNCTION IN PROGRAMMING

1. create `main()` function

2. create a function called `TNRS()`

3. Return a statement so that user can assign a variable to that function to print the value

4. in `main()` function call the `TNRS()` function

5. Take Nothing Return Something is a type of function where during function call user will not send any argument to the function and function will return some value during assign that function to any variable.

## 4. TAKE SOMETHING RETURN NOTHING TYPE FUNCTION IN PROGRAMMING

1. create `main()` function

2. create a function called `TSRN(String s)`

3. Operation something using the `String s` and print the result inside the function.

4. in `main()` function call the `TSRN("Take Something Return Nothing")` and send a string argument to the function.

5. Take Something Return Nothing is a type of function where during function call user will add arguments to the function. and function will print the result inside it instead of return the results to the user.

## 5. TAKE SOMETHING RETURN SOMETHING TYPE FUNCTION IN PROGRAMMING

1. create `main()` function

2. create a function called `TSRS(String s)`

3. Instead of print the resultant value return the resultant value.

4. In `main()` function assign the `TSRS(String s)` to a variable and print the variable. so it will print the resultant which is returned by the function.

5. Take Something Return Something is a type of function where user will send input as an argument to the function and in the end function will return the value to the user so user can assign the function to a variable and get the result by print that variable.
